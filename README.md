# healthy_game
Windows game.

The aim of that game is to arrange the goods by the simple criteria 
if they are HEALTHY or UNHEALTHY. You will see different types of
 food on the screen and your task is to put them in the appropriate
 basket.You've got 30 sec. to put as much as you can. Every correctly
sorted item brings you 1 point, and every mistake costs you 1 point.

To move the item you need to drag and drop it into the appropriate basket using the mouse.
